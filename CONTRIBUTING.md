# Contributing to Kerberos Interactive

First off, thank you for considering contributing. Itâ€™s people like you that make the open-source community such an amazing place.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under **Issues**.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, **open a new one**. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue and use the "Feature Request" template.
- Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it. Provide examples if possible. This allows us to discuss the idea before you invest time in a pull request.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Ensure your code lints and any tests pass.
3.  Issue that pull request!
